!! desc

makes it possible to differenciate between nodes, and decide where a pod should be deployed based on it, for example a pod with alot of cpu requirements should be run on the node with the possibility to provide it

node selectors have limitations, it isnt possible to have complex rules, like "run on any node that isnt size=small". (dosent support OR or NOT expressions)


!! label nodes

```bash
kubectl label nodes nodeName key=value
kubectl label nodes node01 size=Large
```

!! deploy pods based on node labels

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large
```
